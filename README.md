Overview
---
The goal of this project is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video. 

This repository contains my output code which can detect vehicles and annotate them with bounding box in an image or video, along with the other required files for submission.

---

### Check list:

* [VehicleDetector.ipynb](./VehicleDetector.ipynb) - notebook of vehicle detection pipeline.
* [svc_pickle.p](./svc_pickle.p) - pickled file containing trained model
* [output_project_video.mp4](./output_project_video.mp4) - video of bounded box cars on project_video.mp4
* [writeup report](./my_writeup_template.md) - markdown file summarising the results

---

### Other files:

* [Output Images](./output_images/) - (folder of generated output images)
* [Test Images](./test_images/) - (folder of test images for single image)
